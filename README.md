# hcin720-gp
This is a repository that contains all the group projects that I contributed to in 
the Fall 2015 class of HCIN 720: Designing UX for Internet-Enabled Devices taught at at [RIT](https://www.rit.edu)

* [gp1 / tv-tracker](https://github.com/tonyjmnz/hcin720-gp/tree/master/tv-tracker): ambient display that allows you to keep track of TV shows, quickly and unobtrusively informing you about your progress in your tracked shows. Contributions by [Carlos Tejada](https://github.com/ctejada10) and me.

* [final project / gesture-chill](https://github.com/tonyjmnz/hcin720-gp/tree/master/gesture-chill): A controller that lets you take complete control over your tv-watching experience. Allows you to control the playback of your movies/shows and also the lighting of the room by performing sliding gestures over a wooden surface. Contributions by [Carlos Tejada](https://github.com/ctejada10) and me.
