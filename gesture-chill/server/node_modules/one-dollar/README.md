# $1 for Node/browserify

This is a simple wrapper around shape detector library [$1 (1dollar.js)](http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/).

## Install

```sh
npm install one-dollar
```

## Usage

### Verbose (original API)

```js
const OneDollar = require('one-dollar')

const recognizer = new OneDollar.DollarRecognizer()

const result = recognizer.Recognize([
  new Recognizer.Point(1, 2),
  new Recognizer.Point(10, 3),
  new Recognizer.Point(12, 27),
  new Recognizer.Point(3, 25),
  new Recognizer.Point(0, 0)
])

console.log(result)
// Result { Name: 'caret', Score: 0.7524355578423304 }
```

### Shorter API

Original API is quite weird : force using ``new Point``s, title-cased methodsâ€¦ and it's way too verbose.

This module proposes a shortcut for faster access to what you want:

```js
const OneDollar = require('one-dollar')

const recognize = OneDollar()

const result = recognize([[1, 2], [10, 3], [12, 27], [3, 25], [0, 0]])

console.log(result)
// Result { name: 'caret', score: 0.7524355578423304 }
```

Differences from original API:

* no ``new OneDollar.DollarRecognizer``, the function returns directly a recognition function
  * This function accepts ``[x, y]`` instead of ``new OneDollar.Point(x, y)`` (you can still instanciate points, if you really want)
  * This function returns object with lower-cased properties (``{name, score}`` instead of ``{Name, Score}``)
  * In case of no match, the result's name is ``nomatch`` instead of ``No match.``
* you still have access to original methods, but they're camelcased:
  * ``recognize.recognize`` instead of ``recognizer.Recognize``
  * ``recognize.addGesture`` instead of ``recognizer.AddGesture``
  * ``recognize.deleteUserGestures`` instead of ``recognizer.DeleteUserGestures``
  * ``recognize.gestures`` instead of ``recognizer.Unistrokes`` to list user gestures
  * Note that those methods are the original ones, and will require ``Point`` instances
